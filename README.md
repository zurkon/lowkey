# Description

`Lowkey` is a Python Command-Line Interface that stores your Login information for your services such as gmail, Discord and Github. Lowkey encrypts your information to keep it safe. 

The program was developed to work locally without the need to connect to the Internet, including the encryption process, keeping the data more secure on the user's machine.

# Setup

First of all, make sure that you have Python installed on your machine:
* Python version: 3.7.6 or above

Lowkey have dependencies on the modules:
* [PyCryptodome](https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome)
* [PyInquirer](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer)
* [PyFiglet](https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet)
* [pyperclip](https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip)
* [termcolor](https://github.com/hfeeki/termcolor)

So make sure that you have them installed:

```
pip install pycryptodome PyInquirer pyfiglet pyperclip termcolor
```

Now you are ready to go :sunglasses: :sparkles:

# Usage
